*THE HOLY SCRIPTURES*
###### 2 Chronicles 36:11-21 KJV
[11] Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 
[12] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord. 
[13] And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel.
 [14] Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem. 
[15] And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
 [16] But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no remedy. [17] Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand. 
[18] And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon. [19] And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. 
[20] And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
 [21] To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years. 
###### Ezra 1:1-11 KJV
[1] … Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 
[2] Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. [3] Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. 
[4] And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. 
[5] Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem. 
[6] And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered. [
7] Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; [
8] Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
 [9] And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, [
10] Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. [
11] All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them g of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. 
###### Ezra 2:64-70 KJV
[64] The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, [
65] Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women. 
[66] Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; [67] Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
 [68] And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place: [
69] They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments. 
[70] So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, x and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities. 
###### Ezra 3:1-13 KJV
[1] … And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. 
[2] Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. 
[3] And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
 [4] They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
 [5] And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord. 
[6] From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord. But the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid. 
[7] They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. 
[8] Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the Lord. [9] Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. 
[10] And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
 [11] And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord ; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. [
12] But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: [
13] So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off. 
#### INTRODUCING THE LESSON:*
Begin by writing on the marker board these words: exile, captivity, bondage. Ask your students: “
What thoughts come to mind when you see these words?” After your students have answered, say, “Many of the Jews lived in physical exile, captivity, and bondage in Babylon for seventy years, until God, by His providence, gave them freedom to return to their homeland.” 
Then ask,”What spiritual realities that have practical importance for us are represented by the captivity of the Jews in Babylon, and in their subsequent God-given freedom from captivity?”  
(Answer: captivity to sin and God-given freedom from that captivity by His saving grace).
COMMENTARY AND APPLICATION
###### 1. The Fall of Jerusalem*
- A. Cause of the Captivity- 2 Chronicles 36:11-16*
Zedekiah was the last king of the dynasty of David to reign over the kingdom of Judah (2 Chronicles 36:11). 
He was an evil man who refused to repent and contributed to the depravity of his nation. The final captivity of the Jews in Babylon, generally referred to as “the Captivity,” came in 586 BC at the end of Zedekiah’s reign. 
The cause of this captivity was Israel’s persistent disobedience to God, especially in committing idolatry and acts of injustice, over a span of centuries.
God endeavoured to keep Israel from going into captivity by sending them prophets who called them to repent and return to God. 
But, sadly, the people of Israel, and afterwards the people of Judah, foolishly chose to ignore the messengers that God sent to warn them of coming judgement. 
They refused to repent and became more sinful. Eventually,they invited the judgement of God on themselves to the point that His wrath (righteous judgement) “arose against His people, till there was no remedy: (verse 16,KJV). Then, God’s judgement fell on them.
Questions for Application:
The people of Judah sinned to the point that God’s wrath arose against them, and there was no remedy. 
What do you think we should learn from this regarding our own behaviour toward God?
- B. Divine Judgement for Sin-2 Chronicles 36:17-21*
The people of Judah forsook the true God to worship the false gods of the Gentiles, and they adopted the sinful practices of the Gentiles as well. 
Therefore, God used an exceedingly sinful nation of Gentiles  who worshipped false gods to punish the people of Judah. 
The Babylonians (the Chaldeans) invaded and destroyed Judah , Jerusalem, and the Temple . The horror of the divine judgement that fell on Judah is briefly described in this passage.
Ezra, looking back on what had happened to the Jews, noted that the captivity lasted seventy years, just as Jeremiah had prophesied it would (Jeremiah 25:11-12; 29:10). 
Ezra said this duration of the Captivity was compensation to God for all the Sabbath days that had been broken by Israel before the Captivity began (verse 21). 
After the Captivity, this understanding of why the Captivity lasted seventy years caused devout Jews to become diligent about observing the Sabbath.
Questions for Application:
When we have done wrong, how long does it take for God to discipline and correct us? Does this depend on our attitudes and actions toward God? 
Can we either lengthen or shorten the disciplinary process? Explain.
Response to the Word:
God is merciful and patient towards those who disobey and oppose Him. But eventually God will stop unrelenting offenses against Him by administering justices. 
By sending the Jews into captivity, God used the Babylonians to punish and correct them. However the bible documents a variety of other means by which God has sent judgement on repentant sinners: natural disaster, deadly diseases, social disorder, war, economic ruin, and personal and national misfortunes-all because of stubborn disobedience to God.
###### 2. Restoration and Return*
- A. Release from Captivity-Ezra 1:1-4*
The last two verses of 2 Chronicles and the first two verses of Ezra are the same, revealing that the two books, before being separated, were originally one continuing work. 
The verses record the historical account of how and when the release of the Jews from captivity in Babylon came about. In October, 539 BC, the Persians defeated the Babylonians and absorbed the kingdom of Babylon into the Persian Empire. 
The Persian Empire covered most of the known world at the time, and endured for two hundred years, until the time of Alexander the Great.In the proclamation of freedom that Cyrus made for the Jews in his kingdom, he acknowledged that Yahweh, the God of the Jews, had given him dominion over all the kingdoms of the earth (Ezra 1:2). 
This was significant in that the prophet Isaiah had identified Cyrus by name as the deliverer of captive Israel a hundred years before Cyrus was born (see Isaiah 44:28;45:1).
In this proclamation of freedom for the captive Jews, Cyrus also said that Yahweh had commanded him "to build a temple for him [Yahweh] at Jerusalem in Judah" ( Ezra 1:2, NIV).
 Based on this communication he had received from the God of the Jews, Cyrus freed the Jews and invited all who had a will to do so, to return to Judah and rebuild their temple (verse3).
Although the Jews had been held as exiles in Babylon, most of them adapted to their situation, and many of them prospered while there, as Jeremiah had advised them to do  (Jeremiah 29:4-7). 
In fact, many of the Jews were so content with their life in Babylon that they had little desire to return to Judah. Cyrus commanded those Jews who remained in Babylon to give monetary and material support to those who wanted to return to Judah ( Ezra 1:4)
Questions for Application:
Release from captivity is freedom. When people think about freedom, many think first of freedom of expression, or the freedom to earn money and own property. Which is more important to you: those freedoms, or freedom to love and serve God? Why?
- B. Return from Captivity-Ezra 1:5-11;2:64-70*
Led by a large number of Jewish leaders from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and by priests and Levites, many thousands of Jews in Babylon responded to Cyrus' offer to have them return to Judah,
 in order to rebuild Jerusalem and the Temple (Ezra 1:5). In addition to the abundant provisions the returning Jews gathered for themselves (verse 6), Cyrus restored to these Jews all the gold and silver vessels Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple of Solomon (verses 7-8).
To have oversight of the Jews returning to Judah, Cyrus appointed as their governor, "Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah"(1:8), to represent him as ruler of the Jews. 
Better known by his Hebrew name, Zerubbabel, he was the grandson of Jehoiachin, next to the last king of Judah before the captivity.  
Verses 9-11 provides a list of the number of vessels taken from the temple of Solomon, given to Zerubbabel to take with him to Judah.
Ezra 2:64-70 provides the number of Jews who migrated to Judah with Zerubbabel, their newly appointed governor. 
The number of Jews in this first return from captivity in Babylon is given as 42,360 people, accompanied by an additional 7,337 male and female servants, and 200 singing men and women. A grand total of 49,897 Jews resettled in Judah.
Questions for Application:
When the Jews returned to Judah from captivity in Babylon, tribal leaders, priests, and Levites took the initiative in leading the returning Jews. How could this be applied to spiritual leaders in the church today?
Response to the Word:
The post-captivity Jews thoroughly prepared themselves to return to Jerusalem , to rebuild their temple, and there to worship the Lord.
 How do we prepare ourselves to do God's will? To worship God? To live in a way that pleases Him? To minister to others?
Preparation to do God's will is of primary importance; it must not be neglected. Daily, we need to prepare ourselves for Christian living, and for Christian ministry. And the best way is to begin each day with prayer, and by reading and studying God's Word, the Bible.
###### 3. Reconstruction and Rejoicing*
- A. Corporate Worship Restored-Ezra 3:1-9*
Soon after the Jews who returned from the captivity settled in their former hometowns and villages in Judah, their leaders called them to assemble at Jerusalem. 
The large altar for burnt offerings had been rebuilt by the priests and loyal leaders of the post -captivity Jews and it stood exactly where it had been in Solomon's Temple (Ezra 3:1-3).
 This was a cause to gather and to celebrate!
Before the captivity, the morning and evening sacrifices were offered daily to God on this great altar. 
Now, with the altar rebuilt, even though the Temple was not yet rebuilt, the offering of these daily sacrifices resumed on the first day of the month Tishri (September - October).
 After this, the Jews reinstated the religious festivals commanded by Moses, beginning with the Feast of Tabernacles, observed from the fifteenth day through the twenty- second day of Tishri (verses 4-6; Leviticus 23:33-36).
In the spring following their return from captivity, in the ninth Lyyar (April- May), the Jews began rebuilding the Temple at Jerusalem on the same site where Solomon's Temple had stood (Ezra 3:7-9). 
The leaders hired Jewish masons and carpenters to do the work. They paid men of Zidon and Tyre to bring cedar from Lebanon to the port at Joppa. Then the foundation of the temple was laid.
Setting up the altar for burnt offerings, resuming daily sacrifices, re-instituting the the religious festivals, and beginning to rebuild the Temple would all make possible the re-institution of corporate worship as commanded by Moses. 
During the Captivity, the Jews began building synagogues as houses of worship where the scriptures were read and taught. However, without the Temple at Jerusalem, no sacrifices were offered to God, and there was no central location for Jews to gather to keep the religious festivals. The post-captivity Jews saw corporate worship in a new Temple in Jerusalem as essential.
Questions for Application:
The New Testament commands Christians “Let us…not [give] up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing” (Hebrews 10:24-25, NIV).
 In view of this command, what are your thoughts on the attitude some have that corporate worship with the church is not needed, if a person maintains a consistent schedule of private devotions? 
- B. Praising God; Weeping and Rejoicing Ezra 3:10-13*
When the workers finished laying the foundation for the new Temple in Jerusalem, there was a great celebration of the event. 
The priest wore their splendid robes and blew trumpets. 
The Levites struck cymbals and sang psalms to God. They sang in groups, answering one another responsively, “praising and giving thanks unto the Lord” (Ezra 3:11, KJV). They sang with great joy about God’s goodness to Israel, “with a great shout, when they praised the Lord”.
When the Temple foundation was laid, many of the older priest, Levites, and tribal leaders, who had seen Solomon’s Temple, wept. 
Like the younger Jews, they were glad to see the beginning of a new Temple, entirely destroyed because of Israel’s sins, and so they wept. However, “no one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away”(VERSE 13, NIV).
Question for Application
As believers in Christ, we are called to be His witnesses to the world. How can genuine, joyful worship and joyful Christians living help to make is more effective witnesses of Christ?
Response to the Word
While we understand that God is not confined to buildings made by humans hands, church buildings (Christian houses of worship) are visible symbols to the world that there are people in this world who have faith in God and believe in Jesus Christ. 
A house of worship is also the center of the faith-life of the people who gather there for worship and fellowship. 
We should not fail to appreciate the symbolic significance of our house of worship. Nor should we overlook their importance as a place where believers in Christ gather to strengthen
 in their relationship with God and in their relationship with one another as member of the family of God, redeemed by Jesus Christ.
 Our houses of worship are also ministry centers, where people come and find forgiveness, help, healing, salvation and acceptance.
*Call to Discipleship:*
Its was by God’s sovereign power and authority over all things that Jews went into captivity for their sins, were kept through and prospered during their captivity, and were freed from captivity to return to their homeland. 
We are instructed by this knowledge and submit to God’s sovereignty.
To acknowledge God’s sovereignty, we must believe in His supreme power and authority over all events and people, and rejoice in the fact He is working for good in everything. 
To submit to God’s sovereignty, we must, as the apostle Paul said, conduct our living as “labourers together with God”(1 Corinthians 3:9 KJV). 
Jesus always did the will of a His father in heaven. Christians discipleship means working with Christ, and therefore also working with God the Father.
*Ministry in Action:*
As you go about daily life, encountering other people, seek to encourage and inspire them with your optimism and hope, giving expression to your confidence in God’s sovereignty and goodness, and showing by your deeds that you are working with God for good.
